    <introduction>
        <p>
            File handling is an integral part of programming. Most programming languages have the ability to read from, write to, create, delete, move, and copy files.

        <title>Class Imports</title>

        <p>
            Before any code can be written to handle files, the proper classes must be imported. Java includes a class called <c>File</c> in the io library. The class can be imported with the following line. Be sure to capitalize File.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
import java.io.File;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            This class provides a lot of functionality for file hanling, however, the <c>IOException</c> class should also be included and used to handle file operation errors. If this class is not included and a file operation throws an exception, a compile error will occur. 
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
import java.io.IOException;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            Next, the Scanner class from the util library will need to be imported if there is any need for the program being written to read a file. It should be noted that this library is unneccesary if the program will not be reading any data from a file.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
import java.io.IOException;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>
