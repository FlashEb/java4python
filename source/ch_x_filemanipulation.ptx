    <title>File Handling</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            File handling is an integral part of programming. Most programming languages have the ability to read from, write to, create, delete, move, and copy files.  
        </p>
    </introduction>
    

    <section xml:id="file-class-import">
        <title>Class Imports</title>

        <p>
            Before any code can be written to handle files, the proper classes must be imported. Java includes a class called <c>File</c> in the io library. The class can be imported with the following line. Be sure to capitalize File.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            import java.io.File;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            This class provides a lot of functionality for file handling, however, the <c>IOException</c> class should also be included and used to handle file operation errors. If this class is not included and a file operation throws an exception, a compile error will occur. 
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            import java.io.IOException;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            Next, the Scanner class from the util library will need to be imported if there is any need for the program being written to read a file. It should be noted that this library is unnecessary if the program will not be reading any data from a file.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            import java.util.Scanner;
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>
        
    </section>

    <section xml:id="create-file">
        <title>Creating Files</title>
        
        <p>
            Before we can write code that creates a file, we must first import the necessary classes mentioned in the previous section (Scanner is not needed for creating files) and create a class. We will call this class <c>CreateFile()</c>.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            import java.io.File;
            import java.io.IOException;

            public class CreateFile {
                public static void main(String[] args) {

                }
            }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            Next, within the main function, we will create a File object. It is important to create a meaningful name for the File object. We will call ours <c>myFile</c>.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            File myFile = new File("myfile.txt");
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <pre>
            Note: myFile is the name of the object within the program, while "myfile.txt" 
            is the name of the file itself and will be the file name if the operation 
            that creates the file is successful.
        </pre>

        <p>
            Now that we have created a new File object, we can create a file using the <c>createNewFile()</c> method from the File class. While the previous line of code creates an object within the program for the file, this method actually does the work of creating a file and saving it in the current working directory. This method returns a boolean value. If the method returns <c>true</c>, the file was successfully created. If the method returns <c>false</c>, there is already a file using the chosen file name. We can use this method's possible return values in tandem with an if/else selection to determine if the file was created, or if a file with that file name already exists in the directory.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            if (myFile.createNewFile()) { // If the file was created successfully
                System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " was created sucessfully.");
            } else { // If a file with the file name chosen already exists
                System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " already exists.");
            }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <pre>
            Note: You may have noticed the use of another method from the File class; 
            <c>getName()</c>. This method returns a string containing the name of 
            the file. 
        </pre>

        <p>
            The code may seem complete at this point, but if you remember from the previous section, error handling using the IOException is required for program to compile. Let's utilize best practices and add in try/catch blocks to handle exceptions thrown by the IOException class.
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            try {
                if (myFile.createNewFile()) { // If the file was created successfully
                    System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " was created sucessfully.");
                } else { // If a file with the file name chosen already exists
                    System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " already exists.");
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            You may have noticed the <c>IOException e</c> part in the parenthesis next to the catch. This creates a variable called <c>e</c> that refers to an IOException object. In other words, <c>e</c> refers to the error created if the <c>try</c> block fails. The line <c>e.printStackTrace();</c> prints the stack trace to the console. This is what the console may output if the program tries to create a file, but is blocked by the Operating System due to insufficient permissions:
        </p>

        <program language="$">
            <input>
            An error occurred.
            java.io.IOException: Permission denied
                at java.base/java.io.File.createNewFile(File.java:1040)
                at CreateFile.main(CreateFile.java:7)

            </input>
        </program>

        <p>
            At this point, the program will function correctly. Let's add the try/catch blocks to the foundational code written before to get a complete program:
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            import java.io.File;
            import java.io.IOException;

            public class CreateFile {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        File myFile = new File("myfile.txt");
                        if (myFile.createNewFile()) { // If the file was created successfully
                            System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " was created sucessfully.");
                        } else { // If a file with the file name chosen already exists
                            System.out.println("The file " + myFile.getName() + " already exists.");
                        }
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }

                }
            }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            You may be wondering: "What if I don't want to create a file in the current working directory?" Good question! In Windows environments, you can specify the file path using two back slashes for each back slash in the file path. For each pair of back slashes, the first backslash acts as an escape character. So, if you want to save a file to this directory:
        </p>

        <pre>
            C:\Users\UserName\Documents
        </pre>

        <p>
            The line of code that creates a File object will look like this:
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            File myFile = new File("C:\\Users\\UserName\\Documents\\myfile.txt");
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
            If you are working in a Linux or Apple environment, you can simply use the file path with single forward slashes:
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            File myFile = new File("/home/UserName/Documents/myfile.txt");
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <title>Writing to Files</title>

        <p>
            The <c>createNewFile()</c> method is useful for attempting to create files and reporting if the operation was successful, however, createNewFile() does not write anything to files it creates. In fact, if you use <c>createNewFile()</c> to create a .txt file and then open the file, the file will be blank.
